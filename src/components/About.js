        I enjoy development and aim to write code that will serve a need, no
        matter how big or small.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a person who loves learning about all aspects of applications,
        especially in an ecosystem where there are so many ways to make and
        improve what we create. I have not limited myself to a specific
        discipline and have put my foot in various environments to get
        experience I need. Now, my goal is to maximize my knowledge of
        engineering so that I can offer as much value to the creation process as
        possible.
