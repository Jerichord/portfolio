            Hi, I am Jericho, an aspiring software engineer with knowledge in
            various disciplines in software ranging from web technologies to
            embedded software. I am currently focused on gaining professional
            experience and developing apps in my freetime in order to get a

    Hi, I am Jericho, a person who loves learning about all aspects of
            applications, especially in an ecosystem where there are so many
            ways to make and improve what we create. I have not limited myself
            to a specific discipline and have put my foot in various
            environments to get experience I need. Now, my goal is to maximize
            my knowledge of engineering so that I can offer as much value to the
            creation process as possible.
